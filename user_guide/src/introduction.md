# Introduction

Ergo is a concurrent task runner, allowing users to write scripts (which in
simple cases closely resemble typical shell scripts) to describe what they want
done. The scripts manage all dependencies while evaluating and can be used to
expose multiple outputs on the command-line.

This book serves as an introduction to ergo, describing how it works and what you
can do with it. See [Getting Started](tutorial/intro.md) for a tutorial that
steps through the basics and describes some of what is going on under the hood
to build understanding of the tool.
