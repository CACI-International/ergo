# Quick Reference

The quick reference guide below describes all of the syntax and some other ergo
features/behaviors. You may print it out in landscape or portrait orientations.
It should fit in either for letter-sized paper.

Webkit-based browsers (e.g. Safari) do not support custom page layouts for
printing (necessary to set the page margins to layout the content). So printing
with those browsers won't work as intended. If this presents a problem we can
host pdfs somewhere.
