# ergo changelog

## 1.0.0-beta.3  -- UNRELEASED
* Support interactive subprocesses by suspending logging while they run.
* Support dynamically-typed values, and change indexing, array merging, match
  expressions, and set expressions to lazily perform their actions.
* Fix a critical soundness bug around plugin unloading that was causing crashes.
* Change indexing to require the indexed value to exist (rather than returning a
  unit value).
* Add a warning when a string literal is used which matches a key in the
  environment.
* Change maps to be keyed based on values rather than string literals (a
  superset of prior functionality).

## 1.0.0-beta.2  -- 2020-10-07
* Change script syntax, adding pipe operators and indexing/accessing bindings
  with `:`.
* Support calling functions without arguments.
* Add support for `dir.ergo`, which behaves like `workspace.ergo` (and is
  preferred) when a directory path is provided, but otherwise behaves like a
  normal script.
* Change storage command-line option to use furthest ancestor workspace.
* Add syntax highlighting files in `contrib` for vim and highlight.js.
* Use better syntax highlighting in user guide.
